We should follow a data-driven design.
ideas.md has lots of context / information about the game
To make icons, we need to create a asset-generation/prompts/<icon-name>-icon.json file. We should look at other's to get an example of how to make them. Before creating the llm prompt for the icon, you should review ideas.md to get an understanding of the overall game, as well as themes/game-style.json. To generate the new icons we need to run generate_image.py with --theme themes/<theme.json>. To make icons visually consistent, we can define an image dependency. The dependiences need to be created first, because this means that the images that depend on them will now be edits of that image so their prompts should describe how to change those images to create this new image.
