# EON Game Ideas

## Core Gameplay Loop Expansion

**Goal:** Make the moment-to-moment gameplay engaging and give players short-term objectives.

### Completed
- [x] Slime as drawing
- [x] Inventory icons generated, heart chat emoji
- [x] AI gen all new better icons
- [x] Draw items that fall on the ground (or just use their icon probably)
- [x] Health bar?
- [x] Name the game. Improve the top bar with a image of the game title
- [x] Give player a random shirt color
- [x] Show the player holding the axe
- [x] image generation needs to crop the transparent images after doing the transparency
- Fix the way the ui panels in bottom left work.
- Now I want to make a second quest that is only available after the player finishes the first quest. In this quest the wizard asks the player to make cooked rat meat after slaying a rat. The wizard comes up for a good reason for this.
- need to fix data driven design quest check in action_interact.go
- quest indicator when quest is avail. quest complete turn in indicator?

### Current
- need xp icons
- need echo icon
- need a resonance bar
- need actions attacking in resonance
- need to think about dying over all, and as echo
- need to change wizard quest that enables echos
- need to consider if weant to make it so that the quest unlocks recipes?
- need to address echo performance and concurrency

- when you gather resource show icon over inventory. When you equip gear show icon over gear button. When you unequip show icon over inventory


### Backlog
- hosting / deploys / monitoring (?)
- pvp
- discord
- add for designers


#### Quests


#### Experience
- OSRS like with wow like talents

#### Trading
- TBD

#### Talents
- Do talents just unlock stuff for your echo? Talents enhance your abilities and encourage control of your echo

#### Echos
- Allow trading echoes. Setting trades for echos is like the AH system? e.g. your echo can say 12 wood for 1 box or something?
- Echos are based on xp what they do? or is it on events?
- Echos could just be based on talents?


### Ice box
- **PvP?**
    - Needs contested zones?

## Engineer Virality & Emergent Gameplay

This phase is about lowering the barrier to entry and creating systems that generate "unbelievable" stories.

### Ultra-Low Friction Access (The Viral Hook)

- **Guest Mode:** A player should be able to land on your website and be in-game within 5 seconds. No required sign-up. Assign them a random name ("Guest-1234").
- **Easy Account Conversion:** "Enjoying the game? Claim your name and save your progress by creating an account!"
- **Shareable Links:** Implement "Join my Alliance!" or "Teleport to Friend!" links. A friend clicks it, and it loads the game and spawns them near their friend (in a safe zone). This is the #1 way to get new users.

### Define World Zones

- **Safe Zones (Outer Ring):** No PvP. Basic resources (wood, stone, basic fiber). New players spawn here. This is the "safe" economy.
- **Contested Zones (Mid Ring):** Better resources (iron, special herbs). Limited, opt-in PvP (e.g., "flagging" for combat).
- **The Core (Center, around 0,0):** The best resources (rare crystals, enchanted wood), powerful NPCs, and potential "boss" spawns. Full, "always-on" PvP.

---

## Social Systems

**Goal:** Give players reasons to interact, collaborate, and bring their friends. This is the key to virality.

### Chat System

- **Action:** Implement a basic in-game chat with local (e.g., "say" in a 20-tile radius) and global channels.
- **Why:** The most fundamental social feature. An MMO without chat is a lonely place.

### Player Trading

- **Action:** Create a simple, secure UI for two players to trade items from their inventories.
- **Why:** Fosters a player-driven economy, specialization (e.g., "I'm a blacksmith, you're a woodcutter, let's trade"), and social bonds.

### Guilds / Factions

- **Action:** Allow players to form persistent groups ("Guilds"). Add guild chat, a shared guild bank, and a guild tag next to their name.
- **Why:** This is the #1 feature for long-term retention and virality. It creates social obligations, shared goals, and "us vs. them" narratives.

### Co-op & PvP Foundations

- **Action:** Introduce stronger "boss" NPCs that require multiple players. For PvP, you could designate specific world zones as "lawless" or allow consensual dueling.
- **Why:** Creates dynamic, player-driven content and drama, which makes for great stories that players share outside the game.

## The "Player Echo" System (Legacy & Asynchronous Play)

**The Idea:** When a player logs off, their character doesn't just vanish. An AI-driven "Echo" of that player spawns in the world, carrying on simple tasks based on their most common activities.

**How it Works:**

- **The Echo:** When you log off, your "Echo" appears, perhaps with a ghostly or "dreaming" visual. It wanders the world.
- **Recorded Behavior:** If you spent 80% of your time chopping trees in a specific forest, your Echo will be found there, chopping trees. If you were a guard, your Echo will patrol your guild's walls. If you were a crafter, your Echo will stand at their workbench, "practicing."
- **Interaction:** You can't kill these Echos (they're not "online"). But you can interact with them.
- **Virality & Fun:** The world feels always populated. You'd see famous players' Echos and make "pilgrimages" to learn from them. It creates a 24/7 world and a sense of legacy. If you die, maybe your Echo becomes a "ghost" that haunts the place you died, creating player-driven lore.
- The player should have the option to just turn on their echo and watch what its doing. Or when they go afk their echo just takes over.

### Implementation Plan Summary

- **Concept:** Instead of despawning on logout, a player's character can become an AI-controlled "Echo". This can also be manually toggled by the player while online.
- **Mechanic - Resonance:** Actively playing the game builds up a resource called "Resonance." An active Echo consumes this Resonance over time. When it runs out, the Echo will either despawn (if the player is offline) or return control to the player (if they are online).
- **Behavior:** The Echo's AI will be simple initially, determined by the player's highest skill. For example, a player with high woodcutting will have an Echo that wanders near forests.
- **Introduction:** The feature will be unlocked via a new quest, "A Lingering Will," which will introduce the lore and mechanics to the player. The UI for controlling the Echo will only become visible after completing this quest.
- **Player Control:** When a player manually activates their Echo, their own input will be blocked until they "Reclaim Control" or the Echo's Resonance runs out.

## Technical Scaling

### Implement Scalable Zoning

- **Action:** This is the key to your architecture. Refine your Go backend so that you can run multiple Go server instances, with each instance responsible for one or more zones (e.g., Server 1 handles Zone 0, Server 2 handles Zone 1). When a player walks from Zone 0 to Zone 1, their WebSocket connection is seamlessly handed off from Server 1 to Server 2.
- **Why:** This is how you horizontally scale to an "insane" number of players. Your Redis database acts as the single source of truth, and you can just spin up more Go instances as your population grows.

## Experience and Talent System

The progression system will be based on earning talent points to unlock specific bonuses, rather than having levels directly gate content.

### Earning XP:
Performing an action (e.g., chopping a tree, crafting an item) grants XP in the relevant skill.

### Gaining Talent Points:
When a skill levels up, the player earns one Talent Point for that skill's specific talent tree.

### Spending Talent Points:
Players can spend these points to unlock talents that provide passive bonuses. This allows for customized character progression.

### Proposed Skills

#### Gathering Skills

- **Woodcutting:** Chop trees for logs.
- **Mining:** Mine ores from rocks.
